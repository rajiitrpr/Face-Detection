# Real Time Face Detection

## Overview
This project implements a real-time face detection system using OpenCV and machine learning techniques. The system is designed to identify and locate faces in a live video feed, providing an efficient and interactive way to perform face detection.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - dlib
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Detects faces in live video streams.
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Uses pre-trained models for accurate and fast face detection.
- **Visualization**: Draws bounding boxes around detected faces in the video feed.
- **Scalability**: Can be adapted for various applications, including security and user interaction.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TilakSanghvi/Real_Time_Face_Detection.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
